# 10kweather

## 10K Weather Website Project

This project displays current weather information and forecasts for a user's location based on network IP address and/or a submitted address value, and does so with an initial download size of less than 10Kb. The majority of the interactive elements are driven by CSS alone. One Javascript function exists to defer loading of weather icon images until after initial page load. Data is obtained from a number of open data API sources, parsed on the server-side in PHP, and rendered as HTML. Developed for the 10K Apart contest, September 2016.

## Installation

1. Copy the files into a web-accessible directory.
2. Access in a browser.

Note: This web app attempts to use the IP address of a given user's connection to identify location. When working in a local dev environment, the geolocator locator is liable not to work well with a local IP address. You can add a known public IP address as a fallback to use under these circumstances.

## Requirements

* PHP 5.6
* Access to the internet (none of the data will be available otherwise)

## Browser and Device Compatibility

* Functional in modern versions of Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Safari. 
* Functional in IE9+. 
* Successfully tested on iPhone5, iPhone6, Nexus 5X.
